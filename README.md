# trillek-install
This is a script to install the Trillek game, which has been abandoned for about a year.
Because nobody has worked on it for a while, there are some parts of the procedure that must be altered. The biggest alteration is making sure the right version of Selene exists. Without that part of this script, git doesn't want to get selene.
